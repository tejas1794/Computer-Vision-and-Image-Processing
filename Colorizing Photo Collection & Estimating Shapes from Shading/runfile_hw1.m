run('./part1/part1.m');
%I have used my local directory for part 1 and part 2 code.
%For part 1, part1.m has a for loop which takes in all the 6 glass plates and results all 6 images.
run('./part2/run_me.m');
%For part 2, run_me.m should be used to run the program. Since I wasn't able to get the get_surface working, the functions requiring height map are commented out. I do get a surface normal plotted for which I am not certain whether it is the correct one.
